# Graiphic Whitepaper Series

A curated collection of Graiphic’s technical publications covering **graph computing**, **AI orchestration**, **knowledge-driven learning**, and **hardware–software unification**.  
Each whitepaper resides in its own folder with the corresponding PDF and, when applicable, associated source material.

## 📄 Whitepapers & Repositories

---

### **1. SOTA — The LabVIEW IDE for Graph Computing (v1.0 — upcoming)**  
**Theme:** ONNX-native authoring, compilation, and orchestration inside LabVIEW  
**Summary:**  
SOTA provides a full-stack environment for building, editing, optimizing, training, and deploying ONNX graphs directly in LabVIEW. It merges traditional dataflow with dynamic graph orchestration, multi-hardware execution, and unified debugging.  
It serves as the foundation upon which all GO technologies (GO HW, GO GenAI, GO IML) operate.

### **2. GO HW — From Models to Systems (v1.3)**  
**Theme:** Hardware orchestration through ONNX  
**Summary:**  
GO HW extends ONNX into a deterministic control layer for physical systems, introducing GPIO, DMA, ADC/DAC, timers, power primitives, and real-time structures as ONNX nodes. This enables a unified system-graph approach for executing AI and control logic across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, NPUs, and embedded SoCs.

### **3. GO GenAI — From Fragmentation to Orchestration (v1.0)**  
**Theme:** Unified orchestration of Generative AI through ONNX  
**Summary:**  
GO GenAI transforms ONNX into a dynamic execution graph where models, tokenizers, logic, data streams, and hardware execution pipelines coexist. It enables deterministic multi-device inference, visual graph-level coordination, and a continuous workflow from import to deployment — without Python or glue code.

### **4. GO IML — From Theory to Superiority: Informed Machine Learning (v1.0 — upcoming)**  
**Theme:** Knowledge-driven, physics-aware, constraint-guided learning inside ONNX and SOTA  
**Summary (contextualized from the whitepaper):**  
GO IML introduces a new paradigm where **data, physics, logic, and domain expertise become native elements of the ONNX training graph**.  
Instead of training models purely from samples, GO IML integrates:

- physical laws and differential equations,  
- logical rules and symbolic constraints,  
- expert knowledge and mission doctrine,  
- residual models and prior structures,  

directly into the computation graph.

The result is a model that **learns faster, generalizes better, adapts robustly in the field, and remains fully deployable** on any ONNX Runtime backend (CPU, CUDA, TensorRT, OpenVINO, oneDNN, DirectML…).

GO IML is deeply integrated into SOTA’s visual workflow: informed components become drag-and-drop blocks (PhysicsConstraint, RuleGate, PriorLoss, etc.).  
This produces a unified training ecosystem where the same ONNX graph can be:

- designed visually,  
- trained with constraints,  
- deployed unchanged on edge hardware,  
- traced, audited, and certified.

GO IML completes the triad formed by GO HW (graph-to-hardware) and GO GenAI (graph-driven generative AI), creating a **single orchestration layer for intelligence, control, and knowledge**.
